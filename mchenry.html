      <p>The nostalgic McHenry Outdoor Theater continues to make memories for
        thousands of families in the McHenry County Area. With numerous years of
        experience, we at Golden Age Cinemas strive to recreate the entertaining,
        innocent days of the 1950's. Put the kids in their pajamas, get in the
        car, and come out to see two movies for less than the price of one.
        Nothing is more American than spending a summer night under the stars
        watching a big Hollywood movie.</p>

      <h3>Things to know!</h3>
      <h4> Car consideration:</h4>
			<p> At Golden Age Cinemas, McHenry Outdoor Theater, we do our best to ensure that everyone's night is as fun and enjoyable as possible. In order to ensure that all cars have an adequate view of the screen we do have a few parking rules.

    Red poles are located near the outside, front, and back.

    Vehicles shorter than 67" will be required to park next to a silver colored pole.
    Silver poles are located in the center of the lot.
    </br>HATCHES:
    Any vehicle hatch that is blocking the view of those behind them may be asked to be lowered or shut.

      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <h4> What time should we arrive? </h4>
			<p> At our theater we have an expanse of grass that is great for playing with the kids before the show gets started.</p>
			<h4> What if I want to leave and come back? </h4>
			<p>Upon leaving our theater grounds you must pay to reenter.</p>
			<h4> What if we are meeting someone who arrives later in the evening? Can we save a spot? </h4>
			<p>All parking at the McHenry Outdoor Theater is first come first serve. Any objects blocking or saving spaces may be asked to move. We recommend arriving together whenever possible.</p>
			<h4>Do you accept debit or credit cards? </h4>
			<p>We accept debit and credit cards at our box office and in our concession stand.</p>
      <h4>What time does the movie start? </h4>
			<p>Because our screen is located outdoors, we must wait until it is completely dark before the movie may begin. Movie start times will vary throughout the summer depending of the time of sundown.</p>
      <h4>What if it rains?</h4>
			<p>We will always play through our movies rain or shine! We cannot issue rain checks or refunds.</p>
      <h4>Is grilling allowed?</h4>
			<p>No sort of grilling is allowed at the McHenry Outdoor. That includes propane, charcoal, or electrical grills.</p>
      <h4>What's playing next week? How often do you change your movies? </h4>
			<p>We strive to always offer one new release movie that will run for a minimum of two weeks. The second feature will usually be changed every weekend. Because we only have one screen, we usually will not know what movies will play until the preceding Monday.</p>
